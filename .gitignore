# PyInstaller
#  Usually these files are written by a python script; excluding them is not always appropriate
#  if you check in static data generated by your build process, you'll want to take care
#  not to exclude them (e.g. if your setup.py generates some json data that you use in your
#  module, you'll want to commit that json file rather than baking it into your code.)

# PyInstaller creates a temp folder and the exe in the root directory.
# If you want to exclude the temp folder and the exe, uncomment the following lines:

# tmp*
# *.exe
