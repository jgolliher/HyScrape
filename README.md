## Overview

Almost all swim meets are managed and run in HyTek's **Meet Manager**, which utilizes several tools to share results. One of these is *web-based results* which posts the results in an HTML format to a link specified by the Meet Manager operator. The purpose of **HyScrape** is to scrape these results and format them in a tabular format.

## Current Status

Currently, this is in the *preliminary* phase. I have a lot of code written, but it has not been tested to ensure full compatability. I started writing this code in **R** as it is the language I am most familiar with. My plan is to finish it in **R** and then move into **Python** as both a feature and a challenge to myself to code something in **Python.**

## Project Goals

1. Develop code to scrape web-based swim results
2. Develop code to output these results into a tabular format
3. Create an applet which enables users with no prior coding experience to scrape web-based swim results
4. Share the project and code so anyone can use it

## About the Author

Why not include this section? I think it's fun!

My name is John Golliher. I am currently studying to get my Master of Science in Business Analytics at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I also received my Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration, majoring in Business Analytics, from the Haslam College of Business at UTK. 

On top of all of that, I am also a manager for Tennessee Swimmming and Diving; a position I have held since my sophomore year of undergrad. This project was born out of my goals as a manager and my love for data. 

I'm not sure if anyone else will find this useful, but I have an opinion that data and non-sensitive information should be open source.
